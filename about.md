Welcome!!

This is Eddy, a student at White Oaks Secondary School and an incoming student at Cornell. 

Since a young age I've been transfixed by the beauty in math and computer science. Naturally, I immersed myself in contests and web development. I will use this website to document my projects and other interesting things.

In December of 2023 I organized the WOSS Dual Olympiad. Here is the website: My authored problems are available on dmoj.ca/user/404/solved. The contest website is here: https://wossdual.github.io/

In my free time I also enjoy competitive debate, clash royale (I'm top 1000 global), and playing with my dog.
